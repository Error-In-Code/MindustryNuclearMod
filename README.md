# Nuclear Mines (VERY EARLY BUILD)
A Mindustry mod adding more radiation-based items to the game.

## Additions
### Items
- Ionium, a new compound made of thorium and blast compound.
### Blocks
- Ionium Mixer, a block that manufactures ionium.
- Ionium Reactor, a reactor that creates massive amounts of energy at the cost of ionium and cryofluid.
- The Corruption, a turret that fires radioactive shells that do splash damage and irradiate the enemy.
### Statuses
- Irradiated, a status that causes damage over time and lowers health and speed, but buffs attack.
### Units
- Virus, a flying unit that fires radioactive flak bullets at the enemy.

#### THIS IS A VERY EARLY VERSION. DO NOT EXPECT EVERYTHING TO BE FINISHED.

This source code was written by looking at the code of other mods. I did not make this entirely myself.
